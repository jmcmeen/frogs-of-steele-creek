    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It involves training algorithms on large datasets to recognize patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time. Machine learning models can be trained on various types of data, such as images, text, or audio, and can be applied to a wide range of applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, and predictive analytics. Through machine learning, computers can learn to identify objects in images, understand human language, and make predictions about future events, all without being explicitly programmed to do so.\n",

    "Code examples coming soon."
