    "# Frog Species at Steele Creek Park\n",
    "This notebook explores biological nomenclature and local biodiversity through internet technology. We'll examine the dual naming system in biology‚Äîscientific names for universal identification and common names for everyday reference‚Äîfocusing on frog species found at Steele Creek. We'll then explore web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow programmatic access to scientific databases, and demonstrate how to use the pyinaturalist Python library to connect with the iNaturalist API for retrieving real-world observation data and species information about amphibians in our local park ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are scientific names and common names?\n",
    "In biology, species have two types of names: **scientific** and **common**. Scientific names, also known as binomial nomenclature, are unique, universal, and consist of a genus and species name, such as Homo sapiens. These Latinized names are used globally in scientific and academic contexts, providing a precise and formal way to identify species. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, common names are regional, variable, and often descriptive, like \"Mountain Lion\" or \"Red-winged Blackbird.\" While common names can be helpful for everyday conversations and educational purposes, they can be confusing due to multiple names for the same species and lack of standardization. Using scientific names ensures accuracy and clarity in technical discussions, but common names can be useful for engaging a broader audience, making it beneficial to use both in different contexts.\n",

    "In this next section we will work with iNaturalist, which is a global citizen science platform and social network where users can upload photos of plants, animals, and other organisms to help identify and document biodiversity around the world. The platform crowdsources species identification through its community of naturalists and scientists, creating a massive database of observations that contributes to scientific research and conservation efforts. iNaturalist is available to everyone for free via a website, mobile applications, and in your own Python software by using their web API.\n",
