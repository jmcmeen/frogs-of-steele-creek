# Frogs of Steele Creek Park

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the Frogs of Steele Creek Park in Bristol, TN.

So why do these frogs have their own GitHub repo? Well, it's because their behavior is being studied using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. This repository is an interactive overview of the methods and discoveries made at Steele Creek Park.
